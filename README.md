# Contributing
This project uses Quarto (<https://quarto.org/>), a FOSS tool for easily creating high-quality, reproducible, interactive documents, slideshows, websites, and more.

Quarto is cross-platform and integrates cleanly with many text editors.
If in doubt, try RStudio or VSCode.
See <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>

## Getting Started with Quarto
Quarto brings together the functionality of Jupyter notebooks, LaTeX mathematics typesetting, embeddable languages for ex. diagramming (<https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/gantt.html>), and automatic high-quality output to web, pdf, and many more.

This is all exposed using an almost-Markdown text format `.qmd`.

If any of this sounds familiar, it should be possible to be productive in Quarto within an hour:
