# Big Plan
**Simulation**

- [ ] Design: How is it going to work? From first principles.
- [ ] Thermal Simulation: Execute a heat transfer simulation.
- [ ] MVP Validation: Validate that the simulation (and presumptions therein) was done accurately.
- [ ] Validation: Validate that the simulation (and presumptions therein) was done accurately.

**Fabrication**

- [ ] Geometry: Design the 3D-printable model.
- [ ] MVP: Fabricate a first attempt, which should work minimally. **Test with artificial sun at the end**.
- [ ] Production: Fabricate the final product.

**Control**

- [ ] Temperature Sensor: Install the temperature sensor.
- [ ] Shaders: Install the shader control.
- [ ] Instrument: Instrument real-time data, for internal use and for export / graphing.

**Report**

- [ ] Preliminary: The design document (`.qmd`) will later become the report.
- [ ] Body: Writing happens parallel to post-MVP refinements.
- [ ] Polish: Refine report and produce a slideshow variant.
- [ ] Exam: Final preparations and exam.

## Fabrication List
- [ ] Reflector: High-R parabolic shape.
- [ ] Container: Internal parabolic boundary is 3D-printed, around which liquid tubes are wrapped, which in turn are painted with a high-A material that minimizes blackbody radiation loss.

## Shopping List
- [ ] Water Tubing
- [ ] Water Tube Clip
- [ ] 2x Water Container (doughnut?)
- [ ] Black Spray Paint
- [ ] 2x Artificial Sun Test Slots
- [ ] Fabrication Facilities
